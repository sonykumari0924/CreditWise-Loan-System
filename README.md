#### This project develops an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict loan approval decisions for a financial institution. The system uses applicant information such as income, credit score, employment status, and financial history to classify whether a loan should be approved or rejected.

#### The workflow includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature engineering, scaling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation. Multiple supervised learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes were implemented and compared using performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy, and Confusion Matrix.

#### The goal of this project is to automate loan decision-making, reduce bias, minimize financial risk, and improve overall efficiency through data-driven predictions.
